# Intro to the Machine Learning Libraries

## About

This workshop provides demonstrations of the effective usage of popular machine learning libraries on the HPC clusters at Princeton. It shows how to install each library as well as how to write Slurm scripts to take advantage of multi-threading and/or GPUs. The material covers PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Julia, Spark, Rapids, Scikit-learn, R and Snap ML.

#### NVIDIA GPU Hackathon at Princeton

Dates: June 2, 8-10  
[Become a mentor](https://bit.ly/PU_becomeGPUmentor)

#### New GPU Nodes

Della will soon have 20 nodes with 2 [A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) GPUs per node.  
TigerGPU will hopefully be replaced in the Fall.  
AMD GPU node coming to Adroit in the coming weeks.
